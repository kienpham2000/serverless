# S3

## Simple event definition

This will create a `photos` bucket which fires the `resize` function when an object is added or modified inside the bucket.

```yml
functions:
  resize:
    handler: resize
    events:
      - s3: photos
```

## Extended event definition

This will create a bucket `photos`. The `users` function is called whenever an object is removed from the bucket.

```yml
functions:
  users:
    handler: users.handler
    events:
      - s3:
          bucket: photos
          event: s3:ObjectRemoved:*
```
